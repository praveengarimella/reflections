What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git folder is created with the initial metadata for the repository.
	The git system needs to know about a workspace that needs to be tracked.
	So, git init does that.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is to hold the files that I wanted to commit.
	Working directory has all the files that I'm working on.
	Repository stores the complete history of commits.
	Commits are done at various logical checkpoints.
	At each logical checkpoint I want to commit a subset of the files in the working directory.
	Staging is very helpful in this case.
